# GP-EST: A Unifying Algorithm for GP-UCB and Probability of Improvement
This is a matlab demonstration for an algorithm for Bayesian optimization with the Gaussian process assumption. The algorithm is fully described in

Zi Wang, Bolei Zhou, and Stefanie Jegelka. Optimization as Estimation with Gaussian Processes in Bandit Settings. arXiv:1510.06423 (2015).

This paper is available at http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.06423.

To run the code, first install the gpml toolbox by Carl Rasmussen and Hannes Nickisch (http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/code/matlab/doc/).

See gpo_example.m for a full explanation on how to run the algorithms.
